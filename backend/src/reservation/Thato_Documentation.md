# My Responsibilities In The Project:

- The design and implementation of the Reservation system. My main responsibilities include designing the seating plan management system, implementing the Bridge and Observer design patterns, and ensuring seamless communication between different components.

# System Name: 
- Reservation

# What Is The Reservation System's Purpose:

- The Reservation system is designed to manage customer reservations for a restaurant, ensuring efficient table allocation and customer satisfaction.

# What Are The Reservation System's Components:

  - Table Management: Handles table availability, assignment, and occupancy.
  - Customer Reservations: Manages customer reservation requests and preferences.
  - Employee Notifications: Notifies employees (waiters, managers) of seating plan changes.
  - Section Management: Organizes the restaurant into sections (e.g., smoking, private, general).
- aka:
   Reservation System: Handles customer reservations and booking management.
  - Seating Plan Manager: Manages table sections, tables, and the allocation of tables to customers.
  - Observer Framework: Facilitates real-time notifications and communication between different actors in the system, including employees and customers.


# What Design Patterns Does The Reservation System Use:

  - Bridge Design Pattern: Used to separate the abstraction of table sections from the implementation of specific table types. Provides flexibility in managing different table sections.
  - Observer Design Pattern: Used to notify employees and customers about changes in the seating plan, ensuring efficient table allocation.

# What Other Systems Does The Reservation System Interact With:

- Describe any other systems or components your Reservation system interacts with. For example:
  - Restaurant Management System: Exchanges data with the restaurant's management system to update table availability and occupancy.
  - Customer Interface: Communicates with the customer-facing interface for reservation requests and updates.

# Diagrams

## UML Class Diagrams

- Include UML class diagrams that represent the structure of your system, showing classes, relationships, and major components. You can use diagramming tools or software to create and insert these diagrams.

## Other UML Diagrams (activity, state, etc.)

- If applicable, include other UML diagrams that provide insights into the behavior and interactions within your system. For example, you can include activity diagrams to illustrate the flow of reservation processes, or state diagrams to depict the states of tables in the system.
