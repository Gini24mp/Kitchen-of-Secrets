# My Responsibilities In The Project:

- Describe your specific responsibilities and contributions to the project.

# System Name: 
- Reservation

# What Is The Reservation System's Purpose:

- Provide a brief description of the purpose and goals of the Reservation system. For example, "The Reservation system is designed to manage customer reservations for a restaurant, ensuring efficient table allocation and customer satisfaction."

# What Are The Reservation System's Components:

- List the major components or modules that make up the Reservation system. For example:
  - Table Management: Handles table availability, assignment, and occupancy.
  - Customer Reservations: Manages customer reservation requests and preferences.
  - Employee Notifications: Notifies employees (waiters, managers) of seating plan changes.
  - Section Management: Organizes the restaurant into sections (e.g., smoking, private, general).

# What Design Patterns Does The Reservation System Use:

- Identify and describe the design patterns used in your system. In your case, you are using the Bridge and Observer design patterns. You can provide a brief description for each pattern and mention where they are used in the system.

  - Bridge Design Pattern: Used to separate the abstraction of table sections from the implementation of specific table types. Provides flexibility in managing different table sections.
  - Observer Design Pattern: Used to notify employees and customers about changes in the seating plan, ensuring efficient table allocation.

# What Other Systems Does The Reservation System Interact With:

- Describe any other systems or components your Reservation system interacts with. For example:
  - Restaurant Management System: Exchanges data with the restaurant's management system to update table availability and occupancy.
  - Customer Interface: Communicates with the customer-facing interface for reservation requests and updates.

# Diagrams

## UML Class Diagrams

- Include UML class diagrams that represent the structure of your system, showing classes, relationships, and major components. You can use diagramming tools or software to create and insert these diagrams.

## Other UML Diagrams (activity, state, etc.)

- If applicable, include other UML diagrams that provide insights into the behavior and interactions within your system. For example, you can include activity diagrams to illustrate the flow of reservation processes, or state diagrams to depict the states of tables in the system.
